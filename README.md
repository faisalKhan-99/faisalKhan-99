- 👋 Hello, I’m Faisal Khan
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mobile app development. I started with Android but have now shifted to cross platform using React Native. I have 4 months of internship experience as of 15th December,2021. I also develop Wordpress websites and am currently invested in learning Ethereum and Solana blockchains.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any app development project which would help me widen my horizons of knowledge.
