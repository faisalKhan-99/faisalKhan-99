- 👋 Hello, I’m Faisal Khan
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mobile app development. I started with Android but have now shifted to cross platform using React Native. I have 7 months of internship experience and 3 months of freelancing experience. During my period of internship I have made Hobit App with one other teammate which was trending @365 in its category! In freelancing I have helped setup AWS Lambda Functions, AWS RDS, AWS EC2 servers, AWS SES & SNS, AWS S3 static hosting. I am currently learning Ethereum and Solana blockchains and working as a React Native App Developer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any app development project which would help me widen my horizons of knowledge.
